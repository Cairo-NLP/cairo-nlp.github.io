## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, but they face challenges with hallucination and outdated knowledge. This introductory talk explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a solution that combines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with real-time information retrieval from external knowledge sources. Perfect for beginners wanting to understand the RAG paradigm and experienced developers looking to implement their first RAG application.

## Speaker Bio
Hassan is Senior Applied Scientist at Microsoft, with more than 6 years of experience within NLP and AI across multilple locations along with Egypt, US, UK and Canada.
