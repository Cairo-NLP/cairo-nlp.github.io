## Abstract

What does the future of software engineering look like in a world driven by generative AI? In this talk, we will explore a vision of how generative AI might redefine collaboration, automation, and problem-solving in software engineering. From there, we'll connect this future to the present, showcasing real-world examples from Siemens business units where generative AI tools are already enhancing software engineering workflows and increasing productivity. We will dive deeper into one example: Codelevate MASA (https://github.com/siemens-research/genai-for-sw-architecture?tab=readme-ov-file), a multi-agent system that transforms exploratory Jupyter notebooks into production-ready, modular software architectures. We will present a demo and discuss with you the architecture and implementation details of this system.
