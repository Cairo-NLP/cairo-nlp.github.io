We highlight our methodology for subtask 1 which deals with country-level dialect identification. Recognizing dialects plays an instrumental role in enhancing the performance of various downstream NLP tasks such as speech recognition and translation. The task uses the Twitter dataset (TWT-2023) that encompasses 18 dialects for the multi-class classification problem. Numerous transformer-based models, pre-trained on Arabic language, are employed for identifying country-level dialects. We fine-tune these state-of-the-art models on the provided dataset. Ensembling method is leveraged to yield improved performance of the system. We achieved an F1-score of 76.65 (11th rank on leaderboard) on the test dataset.",

        "abstract": "As Electronic Health Records (EHR) become ubiquitous in healthcare systems worldwide, including in Arabic-speaking countries, the dual imperative of safeguarding patient privacy and leveraging data for research and quality improvement grows. This paper presents a first-of-its-kind automated de-identification pipeline for medical text specifically tailored for the Arabic language. This includes accurate medical Named Entity Recognition (NER) for identifying personal information; data obfuscation models to replace sensitive entities with fake entities; and an implementation that natively scales to large datasets on commodity clusters. This research makes two contributions. First, we adapt two existing NER architectures\u2014 BERT For Token Classification (BFTC) and BiLSTM-CNN-Char \u2013 to accommodate the unique syntactic and morphological characteristics of the Arabic language. Comparative analysis suggests that BFTC models outperform Bi-LSTM models, achieving higher F1 scores for both identifying and redacting personally identifiable information (PII) from Arabic medical texts. Second, we augment the deep learning models with a contextual parser engine to handle commonly missed entities. Experiments show that the combined pipeline demonstrates superior performance with micro F1 scores ranging from 0.94 to 0.98 on the test dataset, which is a translated version of the i2b2 2014 de-identification challenge, across 17 sensitive entities. This level of accuracy is in line with that achieved with manual de-identification by domain experts, suggesting that a fully automated and scalable process is now viable.",

Leveraging cutting-edge large language models including GPT4, GPT3-Davinci, GPT3-Curie, GPT3-Babbage, GPT3-Ada, and BERT, the system generates distinctive and challenging clues. Based on a dataset comprising over 50,000 clue-answer pairs, the generator employs fine-tuning, few/zero-shot learning strategies, and rigorous quality-checking protocols to enforce the generation of high-quality clue-answer pairs. Importantly, educational crosswords contribute to enhancing memory, expanding vocabulary, and promoting problem-solving skills, thereby augmenting the learning experience through a fun and engaging approach, reshaping the landscape of traditional learning methods. The overall system can be exploited as a powerful educational tool that amalgamates AI and innovative learning techniques, heralding a transformative era for Arabic crossword puzzles and the intersection of technology and education.",

The main objective of TS is to enhance the readability of complex texts, making them more accessible to a broader range of readers. This work focuses on developing a lexical text simplification system specifically for Arabic. We utilized FastText and Arabert pre-trained embedding models to create various simplification models. Our lexical approach involves a series of steps: identifying complex words, generating potential replacements, and selecting one replacement for the complex word within a sentence. We presented two main identification models: binary and multi-complexity models. We assessed the efficacy of these models by employing BERTScore to measure the similarity between the sentences generated by these models and the intended simple sentences. This comparative analysis evaluated the effectiveness of these models in accurately identifying and selecting complex words.",

The objective of NADI is to help advance state-of-the-art Arabic NLP by creating opportunities for teams of researchers to collaboratively compete under standardized conditions. It does so with a focus on Arabic dialects, offering novel datasets and defining subtasks that allow for meaningful comparisons between different approaches. NADI 2023 targeted both dialect identification (Subtask1) and dialect-to-MSA machine translation (Subtask 2 and Subtask 3). A total of 58 unique teams registered for the shared task, of whom 18 teams have participated (with 76 valid submissions during test phase). Among these, 16 teams participated in Subtask 1, 5 participated in Subtask 2, and 3 participated in Subtask 3. The winning teams achieved 87.27 F1 on Subtask 1, 14.76 Bleu in Subtask 2, and 21.10 Bleu in Subtask 3, respectively. Results show that all three subtasks remain challenging, thereby motivating future work in this area.

        "abstract": "Wikipedia articles are a widely used source of training data for Natural Language Processing (NLP) research, particularly as corpora for low-resource languages like Arabic. However, it is essential to understand the extent to which these corpora reflect the representative contributions of native speakers, especially when many entries in a given language are directly translated from other languages or automatically generated through automated mechanisms. In this paper, we study the performance implications of using inorganic corpora that are not representative of native speakers and are generated through automated techniques such as bot generation or automated template-based translation. The case of the Arabic Wikipedia editions gives a unique case study of this since the Moroccan Arabic Wikipedia edition (ARY) is small but representative, the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia edition (ARZ) is large but unrepresentative, and the Modern Standard Arabic Wikipedia edition (AR) is both large and more representative. We intrinsically evaluate the performance of two main NLP upstream tasks, namely word representation and language modeling, using word analogy evaluations and fill-mask evaluations using our two newly created datasets: Arab States Analogy Dataset (ASAD) and Masked Arab States Dataset (MASD). We demonstrate that for good NLP performance, we need both large and organic corpora; neither alone is sufficient. We show that producing large corpora through automated means can be a counter-productive, producing models that both perform worse and lack cultural richness and meaningful representation of the Arabic language and its native speakers.",

This paper presents our approach to task B of Qur\u2019an QA 2023, part of EMNLP 2023, addressing this challenge by proposing a robust method for extracting answers from Qur\u2019anic passages. Leveraging the Qur\u2019anic Reading Comprehension Dataset (QRCD) v1.2, we employ innovative techniques and advanced models to improve the precision and contextuality of answers derived from Qur\u2019anic passages. Our methodology encompasses the utilization of start and end logits, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and fusion mechanisms, contributing to the ongoing dialogue at the intersection of technology and spirituality.",

These scenarios often encapsulate what is referred to as the \u201cTip-of-the-Tongue\u201d (TOT) phenomena. In this work, we present our winning solution for the Arabic Reverse Dictionary shared task. This task focuses on deriving a vector representation of an Arabic word from its accompanying description. The shared task encompasses two distinct subtasks: the first involves an Arabic definition as input, while the second employs an English definition. For the first subtask, our approach relies on an ensemble of finetuned Arabic BERT-based models, predicting the word embedding for a given definition. The final representation is obtained through averaging the output embeddings from each model within the ensemble. In contrast, the most effective solution for the second subtask involves translating the English test definitions into Arabic and applying them to the finetuned models originally trained for the first subtask. This straightforward method achieves the highest score across both subtasks.",

        "abstract": "Arabic is a complex language with many varieties and dialects spoken by ~ 450 millions all around the world. Due to the linguistic diversity and vari-ations, it is challenging to build a robust and gen-eralized ASR system for Arabic. In this work, we address this gap by developing and demoing a system, dubbed VoxArabica, for dialect identi-fication (DID) as well as automatic speech recog-nition (ASR) of Arabic. We train a wide range of models such as HuBERT (DID), Whisper, and XLS-R (ASR) in a supervised setting for Arabic DID and ASR tasks. Our DID models are trained to identify 17 different dialects in addition to MSA. We finetune our ASR models on MSA, Egyptian, Moroccan, and mixed data. Additionally, for the re-maining dialects in ASR, we provide the option to choose various models such as Whisper and MMS in a zero-shot setting. We integrate these models into a single web interface with diverse features such as audio recording, file upload, model selec-tion, and the option to raise flags for incorrect out-puts. Overall, we believe VoxArabica will be use-ful for a wide range of audiences concerned with Arabic research. Our system is currently running at https://cdce-206-12-100-168.ngrok.io/.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) finetuned to follow human instruction have recently exhibited significant capabilities in various English NLP tasks. However, their performance in grammatical error correction (GEC), especially on languages other than English, remains significantly unexplored. In this work, we evaluate the abilities of instruction finetuned LLMs in Arabic GEC, a complex task due to Arabic\u2019s rich morphology. Our findings suggest that various prompting methods, coupled with (in-context) few-shot learning, demonstrate considerable effectiveness, with GPT-4 achieving up to 65.49 F1 score under expert prompting (approximately 5 points higher than our established baseline). Despite these positive results, we find that instruction finetuned models, regardless of their size, are still outperformed by fully finetuned ones, even if they are significantly smaller in size. This disparity highlights substantial room for improvements for LLMs. Inspired by methods used in low-resource machine translation, we also develop a method exploiting synthetic data that significantly outperforms previous models on two standard Arabic benchmarks. Our best model achieves a new SOTA on Arabic GEC, with 73.29 and 73.26 F1 on the 2014 and 2015 QALB datasets, respectively, compared to peer-reviewed published baselines.",

In this shared task we tackle flat-entity classification for Arabic, where for each word-unit a single entity should be identified. To resolve the classification problem we propose StagedNER a novel technique to fine-tuning NER downstream tasks that divides the learning process of a transformer-model into two phases, where a model is tasked to learn sequence tags and then entity tags rather than learn both together simultaneously for an input sequence. We create an ensemble of two base models using this method that yield a score of on the development set and an F1 performance of 90.03% on the validation set and 91.95% on the test set.",

To enhance the performance of our model, we have employed a multi-task loss variance penalty and combined several training objectives, including the Cross-Entropy loss, the Dice loss, the Tversky loss, and the Focal loss. Besides, we have studied the performance of three existing Arabic PLMs for sentence encoding. On the official test set, our system has obtained a micro-F1 score of 0.9113 and 0.9303 for Flat (Sub-Task 1) and Nested (Sub-Task 2) NER, respectively.

Arabic language has rich morphology and dialectal variations, so Arabic MT in e-commerce training requires a larger volume of data from diverse data sources; Given the dynamic nature of e-commerce, such data needs to be acquired periodically to update the MT. Consequently, validating the quality of training data periodically within an industrial setting presents a notable challenge. Meanwhile, the performance of MT systems is significantly impacted by the quality and appropriateness of the training data. Hence, this study first examines the Arabic MT in e-commerce and investigates the data quality challenges for English-Arabic MT in e-commerce then proposes heuristics-based and topic-based data selection approaches to improve MT for product information. Both online and offline experiment results have shown our proposed approaches are effective, leading to improved shopping experiences for customers.",

This article aims to advance Arabic NER with fine-grained entities. We chose to extend Wojood (an open-source Nested Arabic Named Entity Corpus) with sub-types. In particular, four main entity types in Wojood (geopolitical entity (GPE), location (LOC), organization (ORG), and facility (FAC) are extended with 31 sub-types of entities. To do this, we first revised Wojood\u2019s annotations of GPE, LOC, ORG, and FAC to be compatible with the LDC\u2019s ACE guidelines, which yielded 5, 614 changes. Second, all mentions of GPE, LOC, ORG, and FAC (~ 44K) in Wojood are manually annotated with the LDC\u2019s ACE subtypes. This extended version of Wojood is called WojoodFine. To evaluate our annotations, we measured the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) using both Cohen\u2019s Kappa and F1 score, resulting in 0.9861 and 0.9889, respectively. To compute the baselines of WojoodFine, we fine-tune three pre-trained Arabic BERT encoders in three settings: flat NER, nested NER and nested NER with sub-types and achieved F1 score of 0.920, 0.866, and 0.885, respectively.

However, adapting them for specific tasks requires the time-consuming process of fine-tuning, which consumes significant computational power and energy. Therefore, optimizing the fine-tuning time is advantageous. In this study, we propose an alternate approach that limits parameter manipulation to select layers. Our exploration led to identifying layers that offer the best trade-off between time optimization and performance preservation. We further validated this approach on multiple downstream tasks, and the results demonstrated its potential to reduce fine-tuning time by up to 50% while maintaining performance within a negligible deviation of less than 5%. This research showcases a promising technique for significantly improving fine-tuning efficiency without compromising task- or domain-specific learning capabilities.",

The training set was expanded by sorting tweets based on dialects, concatenating every two adjacent tweets, and adding them to the original dataset as new tweets. We achieved 82.87 on F1 score and we were at the seventh position among 16 participants.",

        "abstract": "In an era of widespread digital communication, the challenge of identifying and countering disinformation has become increasingly critical. However, compared to the solutions available in the English language, the resources and strategies for tackling this multifaceted problem in Arabic are relatively scarce. To address this issue, this paper presents our solutions to tasks in ArAIEval 2023. Task 1 focuses on detecting persuasion techniques, while Task 2 centers on disinformation detection within Arabic text. Leveraging a multi-head model architecture, fine-tuning techniques, sequential learning, and innovative activation functions, our contributions significantly enhance persuasion techniques and disinformation detection accuracy. Beyond improving performance, our work fills a critical research gap in content analysis for Arabic, empowering individuals, communities, and digital platforms to combat deceptive content effectively and preserve the credibility of information sources within the Arabic-speaking world.",

This paper presents (i) ArBoNeClass; a novel Arabic dataset with an extended 14-topic class set covering modern books from social sciences and humanities along with newspaper articles, and (ii) a set of topic classifiers built from it. We finetuned an open LLM model to build ArGTClass. We compared its performance against the best models built with Vertex AI (Google), AutoML(H2O), and AutoTrain(HuggingFace). ArGTClass outperformed the VertexAi and AutoML models and was reasonably similar to the AutoTrain model.",

We present the Handwriting Identification of Manuscripts and Calligraphy in Arabic (HICMA) dataset as the first publicly available dataset with real-world and diverse samples of Arabic handwritten text in manuscripts and calligraphy. With more than 5,000 images across five different styles, the HICMA dataset includes image-text pairs and style labels for all images. We further present a comparison of the current state-of-the-art optical character recognition models in Arabic and benchmark their performance on the HICMA dataset, which serves as a baseline for future works.

This question is important because the available manually-annotated resources are not distributed equally across dialects: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is much richer than other dialects for which little to no datasets exist. How well does a NER model, trained on MSA, perform on other dialects? To answer this question, we construct four datasets. The first is an MSA dataset extracted from the ACE 2005 corpus. The others are datasets for Egyptian, Morocan and Syrian which we manually annotate following the ACE guidelines. We train a span-based NER model on top of a pretrained language model (PLM) encoder on the MSA data and study its performance on the other datasets in zero-shot settings. We study the performance of multiple PLM encoders from the literature and show that they achieve acceptable performance with no annotation effort. Our annotations and models are publicly available (https://github.com/niamaelkhbir/Arabic-Cross-Dialectal-NER).",

This study compares both approaches using an Arabic ASAG dataset. We employ in-context meta-learning for instance-based and semantic score-based similarity for reference-based grading. Results show both methods outperform a baseline and occasionally even surpass human raters when grading unseen answers. Notably, the semantic score-based similarity approach excels in zero-shot settings, outperforming in-context meta-learning.

As a result, automating the detection of persuasive techniques is critical in identifying and mitigating propaganda on social media and in mainstream media. This paper proposes a set of transformer-based models for detecting persuasive techniques in tweets and news that incorporate content type information as extra features or as an extra learning objective in a multitask learning setting. In addition to learning to detect the presence of persuasive techniques in text, our best model learns specific syntactic and lexical cues used to express them based on text genre (type) as an auxiliary task. To optimize the model and deal with data imbalance, a focal loss is used. As part of ArabicNLP2023-ArAIEval shared task, this model achieves the highest score in the shared task 1A out of 13 participants, according to the official results, with a micro-F1 of 76.34% and a macro-F1 of 73.21% on the test dataset.",

        "abstract": "Arabic dialects have extensive global usage owing to their significance and the vast number of Arabic speakers. However, technological progress and globalization are leading to significant transformations within Arabic dialects. They are acquiring new characteristics involving novel vocabulary and integrating of linguistic elements from diverse dialects. Consequently, sentiment analysis of these dialects is becoming more challenging. This study categorizes dialects among 18 countries, as introduced by the Nuanced Arabic Dialect Identification (NADI) shared task competition. Our approach incorporates the utilization of the MARABERT and MARABERT v2 models with a range of methodologies, including a feature extraction process. Our findings reveal that the most effective model is achieved by applying averaging and concatenation to the hidden layers of MARABERT v2, followed by feeding the resulting output into convolutional layers. Furthermore, employing the ensemble method on various methods enhances the model\u2019s performance. Our system secures the 6th position among the top performers in the First subtask, achieving an F1 score of 83.73%.",

        "abstract": "Automatic Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) of text has gained great popularity since it was introduced in the early 2010s. Multiple datasets were developed, and yearly shared tasks have been running since 2018. However, ADI systems are reported to fail in distinguishing between the micro-dialects of Arabic. We argue that the currently adopted framing of the ADI task as a single-label classification problem is one of the main reasons for that. We highlight the limitation of the incompleteness of the Dialect labels and demonstrate how it impacts the evaluation of ADI systems. A manual error analysis for the predictions of an ADI, performed by 7 native speakers of different Arabic dialects, revealed that\u224866% of the validated errors are not true errors. Consequently, we propose framing ADI as a multi-label classification task and give recommendations for designing new ADI datasets.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Bard AI have gained much attention due to their outstanding performance on a range of NLP tasks. These models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across various languages without the necessity for full supervision. Nevertheless, their performance in low-resource languages and dialects, like Arabic dialects in comparison to English, remains to be investigated. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of three LLMs for Dialectal Arabic Sentiment Analysis: namely, ChatGPT based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and Bard AI. We use a Saudi dialect Twitter dataset to assess their capability in sentiment text classification and generation. For classification, we compare the performance of fully fine-tuned Arabic BERT-based models with the LLMs in few-shot settings. For data generation, we evaluate the quality of the generated new sentiment samples using human and automatic evaluation methods. The experiments reveal that GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 and Bard AI in sentiment analysis classification, rivaling the top-performing fully supervised BERT-based language model. However, in terms of data generation, compared to manually annotated authentic data, these generative models often fall short in producing high-quality Dialectal Arabic text suitable for sentiment analysis.",

Arabic, for instance, although the native language of more than 400 million people, remains largely underrepresented in this area. This is due to the lack of labeled data and powerful Arabic generative models. We alleviate this issue by presenting a novel vision-language model dedicated to Arabic, dubbed Violet. Our model is based on a vision encoder and a Gemini text decoder that maintains generation fluency while allowing fusion between the vision and language components. To train our model, we introduce a new method for automatically acquiring data from available English datasets. We also manually prepare a new dataset for evaluation. Violet performs sizeably better than our baselines on all of our evaluation datasets. For example, it reaches a CIDEr score of 61.2 on our manually annotated dataset and achieves an improvement of 13 points on Flickr8k.",

The question arises: Do such common traits influence language comprehension across diverse linguistic backgrounds? This study explores the possibility of transferring comprehension skills across languages to Arabic in a zero-shot scenario. Specifically, we demonstrate that training language models on other languages can enhance comprehension of Arabic, as evidenced by our evaluations in three key tasks: natural language inference, question answering, and named entity recognition. Our experiments reveal that certain morphologically rich languages (MRLs), such as Russian, display similarities to Arabic when assessed in a zero-shot context, particularly in tasks like question answering and natural language inference. However, this similarity is less pronounced in tasks like named entity recognition.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides a systematic analysis and comparison of the performance of state-of-the-art models on the task of fine-grained Arabic dialect identification using the MADAR parallel corpus. We test approaches based on pre-trained transformer language models in addition to Naive Bayes models with a rich set of various features. Through a comprehensive data- and error analysis, we provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches. We discuss which dialects are more challenging to differentiate, and identify potential sources of errors. Our analysis reveals an important problem with identical sentences across dialect classes in the test set of the MADAR-26 corpus, which may confuse any classifier. We also show that none of the tested approaches captures the subtle distinctions between closely related dialects.",

Disinformation can spread through social media in different ways, such as fake news stories, doctored images or videos, deceptive data, and even conspiracy theories, thus making detecting disinformation challenging. This paper is a part of participation in the ArAIEval competition that relates to disinformation detection. This work evaluated four models: MARBERT, the proposed ensemble model, and two tests over GPT-4 (zero-shot and Few-shot). GPT-4 achieved micro-F1 79.01% while the ensemble method obtained 76.83%. Despite no improvement in the micro-F1 score on the dev dataset using the ensemble approach, we still used it for the test dataset predictions.

Considering this constraint, we present a thorough assessment of Bard and ChatGPT (encompassing both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) regarding their machine translation proficiencies across ten varieties of Arabic. Our evaluation covers diverse Arabic varieties such as Classical Arabic (CA), Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and several country-level dialectal variants. Our analysis indicates that LLMs may encounter challenges with dialects for which minimal public datasets exist, but on average are better translators of dialects than existing commercial systems. On CA and MSA, instruction-tuned LLMs, however, trail behind commercial systems such as Google Translate. Finally, we undertake a human-centric study to scrutinize the efficacy of the relatively recent model, Bard, in following human instructions during translation tasks. Our analysis reveals a circumscribed capability of Bard in aligning with human instructions in translation contexts. Collectively, our findings underscore that prevailing LLMs remain far from inclusive, with only limited ability to cater for the linguistic and cultural intricacies of diverse communities.",

In line with contributing towards this ever-growing field, we introduce AlGhafa, a new multiple-choice evaluation benchmark for Arabic LLMs. For showcasing purposes, we train a new suite of models, including a 14 billion parameter model, the largest monolingual Arabic decoder-only model to date.

The Qur\u2019an QA 2023 is composed of two sub-tasks: the passage retrieval (PR) task and the machine reading comprehension (MRC) task. The main aim of the shared task is to encourage state-of-the-art research on Arabic PR and MRC on the Holy Qur\u2019an. Our shared task has attracted 9 teams to submit 22 runs for the PR task, and 6 teams to submit 17 runs for the MRC task. In this paper, we present an overview of the task and provide an outline of the approaches employed by the participating teams in both sub-tasks.",

The previously described system was used in addition to Dice loss as the loss function for sub-task 1A, which consisted of a binary classification problem. In that sub-task, the system came in eleventh place. We trained the AraBERT for task 1B, which was a multi-label problem with 24 distinct labels, using binary cross-entropy to train a classifier for each label. On that sub-task, the system came in third place. We utilised AraBERT with Dice loss on both subtasks 2A and 2B, ranking second and third among the proposed models for the respective subtasks.",

Our analysis highlights the significance of often overlooked aspects in dataset creation, such as answer normalization, in enhancing the quality of QA datasets. Our evaluation also shows that ArTrivia presents more challenging and out-of-distribution questions to TyDi, raising questions about the feasibility of using ArTrivia as a complementary dataset to TyDi.",

Task B focuses on the extraction of answers from Qur\u2019anic passages, employing the Generative Pre-trained Transformer-4 (GPT-4) language model. In Task A, the system is evaluated using the Mean Average Precision (MAP) metric, achieving MAP scores of 0.109438 and 0.06426543057 on the development and test datasets with an optimal similarity threshold set at 0.85. Task B evaluation employs partial Average Precision (pAP), where our system surpasses a baseline whole-passage retriever with pAP scores of 0.470 and 0.5393130538 on the development and test datasets, respectively.",

Existing attempts aimed at controlling the relative isomorphism of different embedding spaces fail to incorporate the impact of semantically related words in the model training objective. To address this, we propose GARI that combines the distributional training objectives with multiple isomorphism losses guided by the graph attention network. GARI considers the impact of semantical variations of words in order to define the relative isomorphism of the embedding spaces. Experimental evaluation using the Arabic language data set shows that GARI outperforms the existing research by improving the average P@1 by a relative score of up to 40.95% and 76.80% for in-domain and domain mismatch settings respectively.",

Using the latest state-of-the-art methods in neural IR, we research what helps to tackle this task more efficiently. Training retrieval models requires a lot of data, which is difficult to obtain for training in-domain. Therefore, we commence with training on a large amount of general domain data and then continue training on in-domain data. To handle the lack of in-domain data, we employed a data augmentation technique, which considerably improved results in MRR@10 and NDCG@5 metrics, setting the state-of-the-art in Qur\u2019anic IR for both English and Arabic. The absence of an Islamic corpus and domain-specific model for IR task in English motivated us to address this lack of resources and take preliminary steps of the Islamic corpus compilation and domain-specific language model (LM) pre-training, which helped to improve the performance of the retrieval models that use the domain-specific LM as the shared backbone. We examined several language models (LMs) in Arabic to select one that efficiently deals with the Qur\u2019anic IR task. Besides transferring successful experiments from English to Arabic, we conducted additional experiments with retrieval task in Arabic to amortize the scarcity of general domain datasets used to train the retrieval models. Handling Qur\u2019anic IR task combining English and Arabic allowed us to enhance the comparison and share valuable insights across models and languages.",

        "abstract": "Understanding Arabic text and generating human-like responses is a challenging task. While many researchers have proposed models and solutions for individual problems, there is an acute shortage of a comprehensive Arabic natural language generation toolkit that is capable of handling a wide range of tasks. In this work, we present a robust Arabic text-to-text Transformer model, namely AraT5v2, methodically trained on extensive and diverse data, utilizing an extended sequence length of 2,048 tokens. We explore various pretraining strategies including unsupervised, supervised, and joint pertaining, under both single and multitask settings. Our models outperform competitive baselines with large margins. We take our work one step further by developing and publicly releasing OCTOPUS, a Python-based package and command-line toolkit tailored for eight Arabic generation tasks all exploiting a single model. We provide a link to the models and the toolkit through our public repository.",

The first KSAA-RD (Al-Matham et al., 2023) highlighted significant gaps in the domain of RDs, which are designed to retrieve words by their meanings or definitions. This shared task comprises two tasks: RD and WSD. The RD task focuses on identifying word embeddings that most accurately match a given definition, termed a \u201cgloss,\u201d in Arabic. Conversely, the WSD task involves determining the specific meaning of a word in context, particularly when the word has multiple meanings. The winning team achieved the highest-ranking score of 0.0644 in RD using Electra embeddings. In this paper, we describe the methods employed by the participating teams and provide insights into the future direction of KSAA-CAD.",

The rise of social media platforms has notably expanded its use as a written language. However, Arabic dialects do not have standard orthographies. This, combined with the inherent noise in user-generated content on social media, presents a major challenge to NLP applications dealing with Dialectal Arabic. In this paper, we explore and report on the task of CODAfication, which aims to normalize Dialectal Arabic into the Conventional Orthography for Dialectal Arabic (CODA). We work with a unique parallel corpus of multiple Arabic dialects focusing on five major city dialects. We benchmark newly developed pretrained sequence-to-sequence models on the task of CODAfication. We further show that using dialect identification information improves the performance across all dialects. We make our code, data, andpretrained models publicly available.",

        "abstract": "Development of pre-trained language models has predominantly relied on large amounts of datasets. However, this dependence on abundant data has limited the applicability of these models in low-resource settings. In this work, we investigate the utility of exploiting synthetic datasets acquired from different sources to pre-train language models for Arabic. Namely, we leverage data derived based on four different methods: optical character recognition (OCR), automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and generative language models. We use these datasets to pre-train models in three different architectures: encoder-only (BERTBase), encoder-decoder (T5), and decoder-only (GPT-2). We test the capabilities of resulting models on Arabic natural language understanding (NLU) tasks using the ORCA benchmark. Our results show that utilizing synthetic data can achieve performance comparable to, or even surpassing, those trained on gold data. For example, our model based on a GPT-2 architecture trained on a combined synthetic dataset surpasses the baseline model ARBERTv2. Overall, our models pre-trained on synthetic data demonstrate robust performance across various tasks. This highlights the potential of synthetic datasets in augmenting language model training in low-resource settings.",

Our findings indicate that the MARBERT Transformer outperformed the other models in performance across all targets. In contrast, the Ensemble Classifier, which combines traditional machine learning techniques, demonstrated relatively lower effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Diacritization plays a pivotal role for meaning disambiguation and improving readability in Arabic texts. Efforts have long focused on marking every eligible character (Full Diacritization). Overlooked in comparison, Partial Diacritzation (\u2018PD\u2018) is the selection of a subset of characters to be annotated to aid comprehension only where needed. Research has indicated that excessive diacritic marks can hinder skilled readers\u2014reducing reading speed and accuracy. We conduct a behavioral experiment and show that partially marked text is often easier to read than fully marked text, and sometimes easier than plain text. In this light, we introduce Context-Contrastive Partial Diacritization (\u2018CCPD\u2018)\u2014a novel approach to \u2018PD\u2018 which integrates seamlessly with existing Arabic diacritization systems. \u2018CCPD\u2018 processes each word twice, once with context and once without, and diacritizes only the characters with disparities between the two inferences. Further, we introduce novel indicators for measuring partial diacritization quality to help establish this as a machine learning task. Lastly, we introduce \u2018TD2\u2018, a Transformer-variant of an established model which offers a markedly different performance profile on our proposed indicators compared to all other known systems.",

We explore diverse training approaches, including contrastive learning, applying a random weighted sampler along with fine-tuning a regression task based on the AraBERT model, after adding a linear and non-linear layer on top of its pooled output. Finally, performing a brute force ensemble strategy increases the performance of our system.

To tackle this, we construct an Arabic dialectal corpus comprising 3.4M sentences gathered from social media platforms. We utilize this corpus to expand the vocabulary and retrain a BERT-based model from scratch. Named AlcLaM, our model was trained using only 13GB of text, which represents a fraction of the data used by existing models such as CAMeL, MARBERT, and ArBERT, compared to 7.8%%, and 21.3%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Intention detection is a crucial aspect of natural language understanding (NLU), focusing on identifying the primary objective underlying user input. In this work, we present a transformer-based method that excels in determining the intent of Arabic text within the banking domain. We explored several machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and transformer-based models on an Arabic banking dataset for intent detection. Our findings underscore the challenges that traditional ML and DL models face in understanding the nuances of various Arabic dialects, leading to subpar performance in intent detection. However, the transformer-based methods, designed to tackle such complexities, significantly outperformed the other models in classifying intent across different Arabic dialects. Notably, the AraBERTv2 model achieved the highest micro F1 score of 82.08% in ArBanking77 dataset, a testament to its effectiveness in this context. This achievement, which contributed to our work being ranked 5thin the shared task, AraFinNLP2024, highlights the importance of developing models that can effectively handle the intricacies of Arabic language processing and intent detection.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces Arabic Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (AraCLIP), a model designed for Arabic image retrieval tasks, building upon the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) architecture. AraCLIP leverages Knowledge Distillation to transfer cross-modal knowledge from English to Arabic, enhancing its ability to understand Arabic text and retrieve relevant images. Unlike existing multilingual models, AraCLIP is uniquely positioned to understand the intricacies of the Arabic language, including specific terms, cultural nuances, and contextual constructs. By leveraging the CLIP architecture as our foundation, we introduce a novel approach that seamlessly integrates textual and visual modalities, enabling AraCLIP to effectively retrieve images based on Arabic textual queries. We offer an online demonstration allowing users to input Arabic prompts and compare AraCLIP\u2019s performance with state-of-the-art multilingual models. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate AraCLIP\u2019s performance across diverse datasets, including Arabic XTD-11, and Arabic Flicker 8k. Our results showcase AraCLIP\u2019s superiority in image retrieval accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling Arabic queries. AraCLIP represents a significant advancement in cross-lingual image retrieval, offering promising applications in Arabic language processing and beyond.",

NADI 2024 targeted both dialect identification cast as a multi-label task (Subtask 1), identification of the Arabic level of dialectness (Subtask 2), and dialect-to-MSA machine translation (Subtask 3). A total of 51 unique teams registered for the shared task, of whom 12 teams have participated (with 76 valid submissions during the test phase). Among these, three teams participated in Subtask 1, three in Subtask 2, and eight in Subtask 3. The winning teams achieved 50.57 F1 on Subtask 1, 0.1403 RMSE for Subtask 2, and 20.44 BLEU in Subtask 3, respectively. Results show that Arabic dialect processing tasks such as dialect identification and machine translation remain challenging.

        "abstract": "News bias is difficult for humans to identify, but even more so for machines. This is largely due to the lack of linguistically appropriate annotated datasets suitable for use by classifier algorithms. The FIGNEWS Subtask 1: Bias Annotation involved classifying bias through manually annotated 1800 headlines from social media. Our proposed guidelines investigated which combinations of keywords available for classification, across sentence and token levels, may be used to detect possible bias in a conflict where neutrality is highly undesirable. Much of the headlines\u2019 percentage required contextual knowledge of events to identify criteria that matched biased or targeted language. The final annotation guidelines paved the way for a theoretical system which uses keyword and hashtag significance to classify major instances of bias. Minor instances with bias undertones or clickbait may require advanced machine learning methods which learn context through scraping user engagements on social media.",

While research on LLM safety is expanding, there is a noticeable gap in evaluating safety across multiple languages, especially in Arabic and Russian. We address this gap by exploring biases in LLMs across different languages and contexts, focusing on GPT-3.5 and Gemini. Through carefully designed argument-based prompts and scenarios in Arabic, English, and Russian, we examine biases in cultural, political, racial, religious, and gender domains. Our findings reveal biases in these domains. In particular, our investigation uncovers subtle biases where each model tends to present winners as those speaking the primary language the model is prompted with. Our study contributes to ongoing efforts to ensure justice and equality in LLM development and emphasizes the importance of further research towards responsible progress in this field.",

Overall, our team\u2019s performance ranked 13th (71.77%) among all participants. Notably, our approach achieved promising F1-scores, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying writers\u2019 stances on diverse topics. These results underscore the potential of Sentence Transformers to enhance stance detection models for addressing critical societal issues.",

        "abstract": "Text classification is of paramount importance in a wide range of applications, including information retrieval, extraction and sentiment analysis. The challenge of classifying and labelling text genres, especially in web-based corpora, has received considerable attention. The frequent absence of unambiguous genre information complicates the identification of text types. To address these issues, the Functional Text Dimensions (FTD) method has been introduced to provide a universal set of categories for text classification. This study presents the Arabic Functional Text Dimensions Corpus (AFTD Corpus), a carefully curated collection of documents for evaluating text classification in Arabic. The AFTD Corpus which we are making available to the community, consists of 3400 documents spanning 17 different class categories. Through a comprehensive evaluation using traditional machine learning and neural models, we assess the effectiveness of the FTD approach in the Arabic context. CAMeLBERT, a state-of-the-art model, achieved an impressive F1 score of 0.81 on our corpus. This research highlights the potential of the FTD method for improving text classification, especially for Arabic content, and underlines the importance of robust classification models in web applications.",

In this work, we focus on the task of generating stories from LLMs. For our training, we use stories acquired through machine translation (MT) as well as GPT-4. For the MT data, we develop a careful pipeline that ensures we acquire high-quality stories. For our GPT-4 data, we introduce crafted prompts that allow us to generate data well-suited to the Arabic context in both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and two Arabic dialects (Egyptian and Moroccan). For example, we generate stories tailored to various Arab countries on a wide host of topics. Our manual evaluation shows that our model fine-tuned on these training datasets can generate coherent stories that adhere to our instructions. We also conduct an extensive automatic and human evaluation comparing our models against state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models.

Focusing on the annotation guidelines and process developed by our team of researchers, the document outlines a systematic approach to discerning bias in articles. Through meticulous analysis, key indicators of bias such as emotive language, weasel words, and loaded comparisons are identified and discussed. The paper also explores the delineation between facts and opinions, emphasizing the importance of maintaining objectivity in annotation. Ethical considerations, including the handling of sensitive data and the promotion of multipartiality among annotators, are carefully addressed. The annotation guidelines also include other ethical considerations such as identifying rumors, false information, exercising prudence and selective quotations. The research paper offers insights into the annotation experience, highlighting common mistakes and providing valuable guidelines for future research in bias identification. By providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating bias in media coverage of the Israel-Palestine war, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities inherent in media discourse surrounding contentious geopolitical issues.",

        "abstract": "The increasing use of artificial intelligence in healthcare requires robust datasets for training and validation, particularly in the domain of medical conversations. However, the creation and accessibility of such datasets in Arabic face significant challenges, especially due to the sensitivity and privacy concerns that are associated with medical conversations. These conversations are rarely recorded or preserved, making the availability of comprehensive Arabic medical dialogue datasets scarce. This limitation slows down not only the development of effective natural language processing models but also restricts the opportunity for open comparison of algorithms and their outcomes. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, GPT-4, Gemini-pro, and Claude-3 show promising capabilities in generating synthetic data. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Multi-Agent LLM approach capable of generating synthetic Arabic medical dialogues from patient notes, regardless of the original language. This development presents a significant step towards overcoming the barriers in dataset availability, enhancing the potential for broader research and application in AI-driven medical dialogue systems.",

Our team reviewed the literature to develop a codebook of terminologies and definitions. By coding each example, we sought to detect language tendencies used by media outlets when reporting on the same event. The primary finding was that most examples were classified as \u201cBiased against Palestine,\u201d as all examined language data used one-sided terms to describe the October 7 event. The least used category was \u201cNot Applicable,\u201d reserved for irrelevant examples or those lacking context.

To enable research on this task for Arabic low-resourced language, we construct and release the first Authority-Rumor-Evidence Dataset (AuRED). The dataset comprises 160 rumors expressed in tweets and 692 Twitter timelines of authorities containing about 34k tweets. Additionally, we explore how existing evidence retrieval and claim verification models for fact-checking perform on our task under both the cross-lingual zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning setups. Our experiments show that although evidence retrieval models perform relatively well on the task establishing strong baselines, there is still a big room for improvement. However, existing claim verification models perform poorly on the task no matter how good the retrieval performance is. The results also show that stance detection can be useful for evidence retrieval. Moreover, existing fact-checking datasets showed a potential in transfer learning to our task, however, further investigation using different datasets and setups is required.",

Leveraging innovative annotation methodologies and drawing on a diverse team of annotators, our approach focuses on meticulously annotating news articles using a linguistic approach to uncover the intricate nuances of bias. By incorporating detailed examples and drawing on related work that show how language structure represented in the use of passive voice or the use of nominalization and the choice of vocabulary carry bias, our findings provide valuable insights into the representation of the Gaza-Israel conflict across various languages and cultures. The guideline we developed detected the bias against Gaza, against Israel and others by setting keywords that are based on linguistic background tested by the AntConc concordance tool. The result was an annotation guideline that have a solid base. Through this collaborative effort, we developed a guideline that contributes to fostering a deeper understanding of media narratives during one of the most critical moments in recent history.",

For text classification (Task 2A), we fine-tune state-of-the-art Arabic language models and use ChatGPT4-generated synthetic text for data augmentation. For image classification (Task 2B), we fine-tune ResNet18, EfficientFormerV2, and ConvNeXt-tiny architectures with DALL-E-2-generated synthetic images. For multimodal classification (Task 2C), we combine ConvNeXt-tiny and BERT architectures in a fusion layer to enhance binary classification. Our results show significant performance improvements with data augmentation for text and image classification models and with the fusion layer for multimodal classification. We highlight challenges and opportunities for future research in multimodal propaganda detection in Arabic content, emphasizing the need for robust and adaptable models to combat disinformation.",

We conducted experiments using many SSL speech encoders on the TARIC-SLU dataset. We used speech encoders that were pre-trained on either monolingual or multilingual speech data. Some of them have also been refined without in-domain nor Tunisian data through a multimodal supervised teacher-student learning.

Using attention masks, we created uniform lengths for each span and assigned BIO tags to each token based on the provided labels. Then, we used AraBERT-base pre-trained model for Arabic text tokenization and embeddings with a token classification layer to identify propaganda techniques. Our training process involves a two-phase fine-tuning approach. First, we train only the classification layer for a few epochs, followed by full model fine-tuning, updating all parameters. This methodology allows the model to adapt to the specific characteristics of the propaganda detection task while leveraging the knowledge captured by the pretrained AraBERT model.

The methodology integrated both manual labeling as well as the application of a natural language processing (NLP) tool, which is the Facebook/BART-large-MNLI model. The annotation process involved categorizing the dataset based on identified biases, following a set of guidelines in which categories of bias were defined by the team. The findings revealed that most of the media texts provided for analysis included bias against Palestine, whether it was through the use of biased vocabulary or even tone. It was also found that texts written in Hebrew contained the most bias against Palestine. In addition, when comparing annotations done by AAI-1 and AAI-2, the results turned out to be very similar, which might be mainly due to the clear annotation guidelines set by the annotators themselves. Thus, we recommend the use of clear guidelines to facilitate the process of annotation by future researchers.",

For instance, an article reporting factual events without derogatory language is labeled as \u201cUnbiased\u201d, while one using inflammatory language against Palestinians is marked as \u201cBiased against Palestine\u201d.Key findings include the identification of various degrees of bias in news articles, highlighting the importance of critical analysis in media consumption. This research contributes to the broader effort of understanding media bias and promoting unbiased journalism. Tools such as Google Drive and Google Sheets facilitated the annotation process, enabling efficient collaboration and data management among the annotators.Our work also includes comprehensive guidelines and examples to ensure consistent annotation, enhancing the reliability of the data.",

We experiment with a Linear SVM approach, as well as two Transformers approaches consisting of BERT model fine-tuning and Transformers pipeline. Our results indicate that we can predict the gender, language and region using the name only with a confidence over 0.65. The country attribute can be predicted with less accuracy. The Linear SVM approach outperforms the other approaches for all the attributes. The best performing approach was also evaluated on another dataset that consists of 1,500 names from 15 countries (covering different regions) extracted from Twitter, and yields similar results.",

Stance detection is crucial for applications such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining, and social media monitoring, as it helps in capturing the nuanced perspectives of users on various subjects. As part of the ArabicNLP 2024 program, we organized the first shared task on Arabic Stance Detection, StanceEval 2024.

        "abstract": "Accurate translation of terminology and adaptation to in-context information is a pillar to high quality translation. Recently, there is a remarkable interest towards the use and the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) particularly for Machine Translation tasks. Nevertheless, despite their recent advancement and ability to understand and generate human-like language, these LLMs are still far from perfect, especially in domain-specific scenarios, and need to be thoroughly investigated. This is particularly evident in automatically translating legal terminology from Arabic into English and French, where, beyond the inherent complexities of legal language and specialised translations, technical limitations of LLMs further hinder accurate generation of text. In this paper, we present a preliminary evaluation of two evolving LLMs, namely GPT-4 Generative Pre-trained Transformer and Gemini, as legal translators of Arabic legislatives to test their accuracy and the extent to which they care for context and terminology across two language pairs (AR\u2192EN / AR\u2192FR). The study targets the evaluation of Zero-Shot prompting for in-context and out-of-context scenarios of both models relying on a gold standard dataset, verified by professional translators who are also experts in the field. We evaluate the results applying the Multidimensional Quality Metrics to classify translation errors. Moreover, we also evaluate the general LLMs outputs to verify their correctness, consistency, and completeness. In general, our results show that the models are far from perfect and recall for more fine-tuning efforts using specialised terminological data in the legal domain from Arabic into English and French.",

        "abstract": "Arabic banking intent detection represents a challenging problem across multiple dialects. It imposes generalization difficulties due to the scarcity of Arabic language and its dialects resources compared to English. We propose a methodology that leverages contrastive training to overcome this limitation. We also augmented the data with several dialects using a translation model. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of our approach in capturing linguistic nuances across different Arabic dialects as well as accurately differentiating between banking intents across diverse linguistic landscapes. This would enhance multi-dialect banking services in the Arab world with limited Arabic language resources. Using our proposed method we achieved second place on subtask 1 leaderboard of the AraFinNLP2024 shared task with micro-F1 score of 0.8762 on the test split.",

This approach significantly improved translation quality, achieving a BLEU score of 0.1713.

Under the supervised setup, we used the model trained using NADI 2023 data and devised approaches to convert the multi-class predictions to multi-label by using information from the confusion matrix or using calibrated probabilities. Under unsupervised settings, we used the Arabic-based sentence encoders and multilingual cross-encoders to retrieve similar samples from the training set, considering each test input as a query. The associated labels are then assigned to the input query. We also tried different variations, such as co-occurring dialects derived from the provided development set.

Since no syntactically annotated data exist for Arabic dialects, we train the parser on a Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) corpus, which creates an out-of-domain setting.We investigate methods to close the gap between the source (MSA) and target data (dialects), e.g., by training on syntactically similar sentences to the test data. For testing, we manually annotate a small data set from a dialectal corpus. We focus on parsing two linguistic phenomena, which are difficult to parse: Idafa and coordination. We find that we can improve results by adding in-domain MSA data while adding dialectal embeddings only results in minor improvements.",

        "abstract": "Training LLMs in low resources languages usually utilizes machine translation (MT) data augmentation from English language. However, translation brings a number of challenges: there are large costs attached to translating and curating huge amounts of content with high-end machine translation solutions; the translated content carries over cultural biases; and if the translation is not faithful and accurate, the quality of the data degrades causing issues in the trained model. In this work, we investigate the role of translation and synthetic data in training language models. We translate TinyStories, a dataset of 2.2M short stories for 3-4 year old children, from English to Arabic using the open NLLB-3B MT model. We train a number of story generation models of size 1M-33M parameters using this data. We identify a number of quality and task-specific issues in the resulting models. To rectify these issues, we further pre-train the models with a small dataset of synthesized high-quality stories generated by a capable LLM in Arabic, representing 1% of the original training data. We show, using GPT-4 as a judge and dictionary learning analysis from mechanistic interpretability, that the suggested approach is a practical means to resolve some of the translation pitfalls. We illustrate the improvement through case studies of linguistic and cultural bias issues.",

One important component of natural language processing (NLP) is intent detection, which is significant to the finance sector. Limited studies have been conducted in the field of finance using languages with limited resources like Arabic, despite notable works being done in high-resource languages like English. To advance Arabic NLP in the financial domain, the organizer of AraFinNLP 2024 has arranged a shared task for detecting banking intents from the queries in various Arabic dialects, introducing a novel dataset named ArBanking77 which includes a collection of banking queries categorized into 77 distinct intents classes. To accomplish this task, we have presented a hierarchical approach called Dual-Phase-BERT in which the detection of dialects is carried out first, followed by the detection of banking intents. Using the provided ArBanking77 dataset, we have trained and evaluated several conventional machine learning, and deep learning models along with some cutting-edge transformer-based models. Among these models, our proposed Dual-Phase-BERT model has ranked7thout of all competitors, scoring 0.801 on the scale of F1-score on the test set.",

The second consists of synthetically generated STEM questions, created using the same sources.

We introduce a three-stage framework, AutoArabic, utilizing state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to translate non-Arabic benchmarks into Modern Standard Arabic, reducing the manual revision required by nearly fourfold. The framework incorporates an error detection module that automatically flags potential translation errors with 97% accuracy. Applying the framework to DiDeMo, a video retrieval benchmark produces DiDeMo-AR, an Arabic variant with 40,144 fluent Arabic descriptions. An analysis of the translation errors is provided and organized into an insightful taxonomy to guide future Arabic localization efforts. We train a CLIP-style baseline with identical hyperparameters on the Arabic and English variants of the benchmark, finding a moderate performance gap (\ud835\udee5 \u2248 3pp at Recall@1), indicating that Arabic localization preserves benchmark difficulty. We evaluate three post-editing budgets (zero/ flagged-only/ full) and find that performance improves monotonically with more post-editing, while the raw LLM output (zero-budget) remains usable.

To bridge this gap and enable robust Arabic AES, this paper introduces thefirst publicly-availablecomprehensive set of engineered features tailored for Arabic AES, covering surface-level, readability, lexical, syntactic, and semantic features. Experiments are conducted on a dataset of 620 Arabic essays, each annotated with both holistic and trait-specific scores. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed feature set is effective across different models and competitive with recent NLP advances including LLMs, establishing the state-of-the-art performance and providing strong baselines for future Arabic AES research. Moroever, the resulting feature set offers a reusable and foundational resource, contributing towards the development of more effective Arabic AES systems.",

        "abstract": "Classical Arabic represents a significant era that encompasses the golden age of Arab culture, philosophy, and scientific literature. With a broad consensus on the importance of translating these literatures to enrich knowledge dissemination across communities, the advent of large language models (LLMs) and translation systems offers promising tools to facilitate this goal. However, we have identified a scarcity of translation datasets in Classical Arabic, which are often limited in scope and topics, hindering the development of high-quality translation systems. In response, we present the ATHAR dataset, which comprises 66,000 high-quality classical Arabic to English translation samples that cover a wide array of topics including science, culture, and philosophy. Furthermore, we assess the performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs under various settings, concluding that there is a need for such datasets in current systems. Our findings highlight how models can benefit from fine-tuning or incorporating this dataset into their pretraining pipelines. The dataset is publicly available on the HuggingFace Data Hub. To preserve anonymity during review, we additionally provide an anonymized snapshot at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c_ElsblaOJzQ0TW_M1DugjR2o3Xv9RUo.",

We introduce Shawarma Chats, a benchmark of 30,000 six-turn conversations grounded in Wikipedia content, evenly split across the three dialects. To build this corpus, we prompt five frontier LLMs GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Qwen-Plus, DeepSeek-Chat, and Mistral Large to generate 1,500 seed dialogues. Native Arabic speakers evaluate these outputs to select the most effective generator and most human-aligned grader. Sub-A dialogues undergo a two-pass, rationale-driven self-repair loop where the grader critiques and the generator revises; unresolved cases are manually corrected. We apply this pipeline to 10,000 Wikipedia paragraphs to create 30,000 high-quality conversations 10,000 per dialect\u2014at modest human cost. To validate the benchmark, we LoRA-fine-tune six open LLMs (1\u201324 B parameters) on Shawarma Chats and observe consistent gains in automatic-grader scores, BERTScore, BLEU and ROUGE particularly for models larger than 7 B parameters. Shawarma Chats thus establishes the first large-scale, dialect-aware, content-grounded dialogue benchmark for Arabic.",

Our work discusses a rule-based grapheme-to-beat transformation tailored for extracting the rhythm from fully diacritized Arabic script. Our approach employs a conditional denoising objective to fine-tune ByT5, where the model reconstructs masked words to match a target rhythm. We adopt a curriculum learning strategy, pre-training on a general Arabic dataset before fine-tuning on poetic dataset, and explore cross-lingual transfer from English to Arabic. Experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve high rhythmic alignment while maintaining semantic coherence. The proposed model has the potential to be used in co-creative applications in the process of composing classical Arabic poems.",

To address these issues, we propose an information extraction ontology, , which covers a wide range of named entity types and relations. serves as a semantic mediation framework that facilitates alignment across heterogeneous tagsets and annotation guidelines. We propose two ontology-based mapping methods: (i) as a set of mapping rules for uni-directional tagset alignment; and (ii) as ontology-based prompting, which incorporates the ontology concepts directly into prompts, enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform more effective and bi-directional mappings. Our experiments show a 15% improvement in out-of-domain mapping accuracy when using ontology-based prompting compared to rule-based methods.

While standard forms of languages have gained attention in that regard, dialectal speech, which often serves as the primary means of spoken communication for many communities, as it is the case for Arabic, has not received the same level of focus. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end dialectal G2P for Egyptian Arabic, a dialect without standard orthography. Our novel architecture accomplishes three tasks: (i) restores short vowels of the diacritical marks for the dialectal text; (ii) maps certain characters that happen only in the spoken version of the dialectal Arabic to their dialect-specific character transcriptions; and finally (iii) converts the previous step output to the corresponding phoneme sequence. We benchmark G2P on a modular cascaded system, a large language model, and our multi-task end-to-end architecture.",

By orchestrating multiple specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover, we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We releaseAraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs).

This work is in line with the ongoing effort to mitigate the data scarcity obstacle for a number of Arabic dialects. We collected, segmented, transcribed and translated 108 TEDx talks following our internally developed annotations guidelines. The. collected talks represent 25 hours of speech with code-switching that cover speakers with various accents from over 11 different regions of Tunisia. We make the annotation guidelines and corpus publicly available. This will enable the extension of TEDxTN to new talks as they become available. We also report results for strong baseline systems of Speech Recognition and Speech Translation using multiple pre-trained and fine-tuned end-to-end models. This corpus is the first open source and publicly available speech translation corpus of Code-Switching Tunisian dialect. We believe that this is a valuable resource that can motivate and facilitate further research studying Tunisian Dialect.",

        "abstract": "Despite the growing importance of online discourse, Arabic-speaking communities lack platforms that support structured, culturally grounded debate. Mainstream social media rarely fosters constructive engagement, often leading to polarization and superficial exchanges. This paper proposes the development of a culturally aware debate platform tailored to the values and traditions of Arabic-speaking users, with a focus on leveraging advances in natural language processing (NLP). We present findings from a user survey that explores experiences with existing debate tools and expectations for future platforms. Besides, we analyze 30,000 English-language debate topics using large language models (LLMs) to assess their cultural relevance and appropriateness for Arab audiences. We further examine the ability of LLMs to generate new culturally resonant debate topics, contributing to the emerging tasks of culture-aware topic assessment and generation. Finally, we propose a theoretical and technical framework for building an NLP-supported Arabic debate platform. Our work highlights the urgent need for culturally sensitive NLP resources that foster critical thinking, digital literacy, and meaningful deliberation in Arabic.",

To address data scarcity, we built a synthetic dataset of on-topic and off-topic pairs and evaluated multiple models, including threshold-based classifiers, SVMs, causal LLMs, and a fine-tuned masked SBERT model. For real-data evaluation, we combined QAES with ZAEBUC, creating off-topic pairs via mismatched prompts. We also tested prompt expansion strategies using AraVec, CAMeL, and GPT-4o. Our fine-tuned SBERT achieved 98% F1 on synthetic data and strong results on QAES+ZAEBUC, outperforming SVMs and threshold-based baselines and offering a resource-efficient alternative to LLMs. This work establishes the first benchmark for Arabic prompt relevance and provides practical strategies for low-resource AES.",

We further assess the impact of annotation noise introduced during translation by manually correcting portions of the projected training data. In addition, we investigate the potential of prompting large language models (LLMs) for the task. Experiments on a manually corrected Arabic test set show that monolingual models trained on translated data achieve the strongest performance, with further improvements from small-scale manual correction of training examples.",

The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the court, the verdict, as well the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks and demonstrate the dataset\u2019s utility for instruction tuning.

This complex word structure used by humans is obscured to neural models that employ traditional tokenization algorithms, such as byte-pair encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016; Gage, 1994). In this work, we present and evaluate Semitic Root Encoding (SRE), a tokenization method that represents both concatenative and non-concatenative structures in Semitic words with sequences of root, template stem, and BPE tokens. We apply the method to neural machine translation (NMT) and find that SRE tokenization yields an average increase of 1.15 BLEU over the baseline. SRE tokenization is also robust against generating combinations of roots with template stems that do not occur in nature. Finally, we compare the performance of SRE to tokenization based on non-linguistic root and template structures and tokenization based on stems, providing evidence that NMT models are capable of leveraging tokens based on non-concatenative Semitic morphology.",

Despite the growing number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs\u2019 hallucination in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is particularly pressing given Arabic\u2019s widespread use across many regions and its importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs, including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4 reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of LLMs\u2019 outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a comparative performance with reasoning-based models.

However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic) tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.",

        "abstract": "For effective use in specific countries, Large Language Models (LLMs) need a strong grasp of local culture and core knowledge to ensure socially appropriate, context-aware, and factually correct responses. Existing Arabic and Saudi benchmarks are limited, focusing mainly on dialects or lifestyle, with little attention to deeper cultural or domain-specific alignment from authoritative sources. To address this gap and the challenge LLMs face with non-Western cultural nuance, this study introduces the Saudi-Alignment Benchmark. It consists of 874 manually curated questions across two core cultural dimensions: Saudi Cultural and Ethical Norms, and Saudi Domain Knowledge. These questions span multiple subcategories and use three formats to assess different goals with verified sources. Our evaluation reveals significant variance in LLM alignment. GPT-4 achieved the highest overall accuracy (83.3%), followed by ALLaM-7B (81.8%) and Llama-3.3-70B (81.6%), whereas Jais-30B exhibited a pronounced shortfall at 21.9%. Furthermore, multilingual LLMs excelled in norms; ALLaM-7B in domain knowledge. Considering the effect of question format, LLMs generally excelled in selected-response formats but showed weaker results on generative tasks, indicating that recognition-based benchmarks alone may overestimate cultural and contextual alignment. These findings highlight the need for tailored benchmarks and reveal LLMs\u2019 limitations in achieving cultural grounding, particularly in underrepresented contexts like Saudi Arabia.",

        "abstract": "We address the task of reverse dictionary modeling in Arabic, where the goal is to retrieve a target word given its definition. The task comprises two subtasks: (1) generating embeddings for Arabic words based on Arabic glosses, and (2) a cross-lingual setting where the gloss is in English and the target embedding is for the corresponding Arabic word. Prior approaches have largely relied on BERT models such as CAMeLBERT or MARBERT trained with mean squared error loss. In contrast, we propose a novel ensemble architecture that combines MARBERTv2 with the encoder of AraBART, and we demonstrate that the choice of loss function has a significant impact on performance. We apply contrastive loss to improve representational alignment, and introduce structural and center losses to better capture the semantic distribution of the dataset. This multi-loss framework enhances the quality of the learned embeddings and leads to consistent improvements in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. Our system achieved the best rank metric in both subtasks compared to the previous approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining architectural diversity with task-specific loss functions in representational tasks for morphologically rich languages like Arabic.",

We introduce a novel evaluation framework that assesses both dialectal fidelity via dual evaluation: LLM-based automated scoring and human assessments by native speakers. Our results demonstrate that the merged model effectively handles cross-dialect medical scenarios, such as interpreting Moroccan Darija inputs for Egyptian Arabic-speaking clinicians, while maintaining high clinical relevance. The merging process reduced computational cost by over 60% compared to per-dialect fine-tuning, highlighting its viability for resource-constrained settings.

Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption, recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low adoption across the community.

Using this method, we pretrain BERTbased models on normalized Modern Standard Arabic and French only and evaluate them on Named Entity Recognition (NER) and text classification.

Image-text pair datasets are the standard choice for pretraining multimodal large language models. However, they are often derived from image alt-text metadata, which is typically brief and context-poor, disconnecting images from their broader meaning. Although significant advances have been made in building interleaved image-text datasets for English, such as the OBELICS dataset, a substantial gap remains for native Arabic content. Our processing covered 8.6 million Arabic web pages, yielding 5.8 million associated images and 1.3 billion text tokens. The final dataset includes interleaved image-text documents and question-answer pairs, featuring 2.8 million high-quality interleaved documents and 5 million QA pairs. Alongside the dataset, we release the complete pipeline and code, ensuring reproducibility and encouraging further research and development. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AMCrawl, we introduce a publicly available native Arabic Vision Language model, trained with 13 billion parameters. These models achieve competitive results when benchmarked against publicly available datasets. AMCrawl bridges a critical gap in Arabic multimodal resources, providing a robust foundation for developing Arabic multimodal large language models and fostering advancements in this underrepresented area.

Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior.Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with substantial performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever\u2019s difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose two simple retrieval strategies that address this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages or by translating the query, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.",

It includes 78 NLP tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.",

Unlike previous systems relying on discrete MFCC features and 1D convolutions, which miss nuanced spectro-temporal patterns, ArabEmoNet uses Mel spectrograms processed through 2D convolutions, preserving critical emotional cues often lost in traditional methods. While recent models favor large-scale architectures with millions of parameters, ArabEmoNet achieves superior results with just 1 million parameters\u201490 times smaller than HuBERT base and 74 times smaller than Whisper. This efficiency makes it ideal for resource-constrained environments. ArabEmoNet advances Arabic speech emotion recognition, offering exceptional performance and accessibility for real-world applications.",

In this work, we present the first results on open-domain Arabic CQA using deep learning. We introduce AraQReCC, a large-scale Arabic CQA dataset containing 9K conversations with 62K question-answer pairs, created by translating a subset of the QReCC dataset. To ensure data quality, we used COMET-based filtering and manual ratings from large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and LLaMA, selecting conversations with COMET scores, along with LLM ratings of 4 or more. AraQReCC facilitates advanced research in Arabic CQA, improving clarity and relevance through question rewriting. We applied AraT5 for question rewriting and used BM25 and Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) for passage retrieval. AraT5 is also used for question answering, completing the end-to-end system. Our experiments show that the best performance is achieved with DPR, attaining an F1 score of 21.51% on the test set. While this falls short of the human upper bound of 40.22%, it underscores the importance of question rewriting and quality-controlled data in enhancing system performance.",

        "abstract": "The quality of training data plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs). This is especially true for low-resource languages where high-quality content is relatively scarce. Inspired by the success of FineWeb-Edu for English, we construct a native Arabic educational-quality dataset using similar methodological principles. We begin by sampling 1 million Arabic web documents from Common Crawl and labeling them into six quality classes (0\u20135) with Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct model using a classification prompt adapted from FineWeb-Edu. These labeled examples are used to train a robust classifier capable of distinguishing educational content from general web text. We train a classification head on top of a multilingual 300M encoder model, then use this classifier to filter a large Arabic web corpus, discarding documents with low educational value. To evaluate the impact of this curation, we pretrain from scratch two bilingual English-Arabic 7B LLMs on 800 billion tokens using the filtered and unfiltered data and compare their performance across a suite of benchmarks. Our results show a significant improvement when using the filtered educational dataset, validating the effectiveness of quality filtering as a component in a balanced data mixture for Arabic LLM development. This work addresses the scarcity of high-quality Arabic training data and offers a scalable methodology for curating educational quality content in low-resource languages.",

Results show that multilingual models consistently outper- form Arabic-language models. The Mistral-large achieved the highest accuracy in Task 1 (72%) us- ing basic RAG with our augmented knowledge resource, while GPT-4o with RAG and K2R re- trieval achieved the best score in Task 2 (87.71%). These \ufb01ndings highlight the effectiveness of RAG in enhancing LLM performance for complex Is- lamic reasoning and knowledge assessment tasks.",

Task 1 requires pre- dicting the readability level of an Arabic sen- tence on a scale from 1 (easiest) to 19 (hardest), reflecting reading difficulty. Our approach in- tegrates contextual and syntactic information by combining pretrained BERT embeddings (Devlin et al., 2019) with a Graph Neural Net- work (GNN) (Zhou et al., 2021) over depen- dency parse trees (Kipf and Welling, 2017). Our hypothesis is that readability is influenced not only by word choice but also by syntac- tic complexity\u2014especially in morphologically rich languages like Arabic (Habash, 2010). To capture both aspects, we represent each sen- tence as a dependency graph with BERT token embeddings as node features, and use a GNN to model the syntactic structure. Experimental results show that our syntax-aware model im- proves over a strong BERT baseline, highlight- ingthevalueofstructurallinguisticinformation for fine-grained readability classification.1",

We develop a system based on pre-trained Arabic BERT mod- els with three fine-tuning strategies, combined with a custom preprocessing pipeline for noise removal, normalization, and diacritic stripping. To address class imbalance and lexical sparsity, we augment the training data with synthetically generated paraphrases via the OpenAI API. Ex- perimental results on the official test set demon- strate that our best configuration, BERT-base- AraBERTv02 + NN with cleaning and gener- ated data, achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.6747 F1. Error analysis reveals that mislabeled train- ing instances significantly limit model perfor- mance, suggesting that future improvements may be achieved through systematic dataset refinement.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new Arabic image cap- tioning dataset created for the ImageEval 2025 Shared Task. The dataset focuses on images related to con\ufb02ict, resistance, and everyday life under occupation. Each image is paired with a Modern Standard Arabic caption of 40\u201370 words that describes what is shown and adds cultural or emotional context. To help anno- tators write rich and consistent captions, we used prompt-based guidelines, including step- by-step reasoning and writing from speci\ufb01c roles such as journalists or humanitarian ob- servers. This method produced captions that are both descriptive and meaningful. The dataset \ufb01lls an important gap in Arabic resources, espe- cially for sensitive and historically signi\ufb01cant topics. It can be used to train and evaluate Ara- bic vision language models, test multilingual AI systems, and support applications in journalism, education, and cultural preservation.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently re- flect the vast data distributions they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently, LLMs of- ten exhibit a diminished understanding of cer- tain communities, a gap that is particularly evi- dent in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures. This issue becomes even more pro- nounced with increasingly under-represented topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first shared task de- signed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring multiple- choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our findings re- veal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15% on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient fine- tuning emerged as the predominant and mos",

Performance was assessed us- ing BLEU, ROUGE, cosine similarity, and an LLM-based semantic evaluation. Results show that CRAFT achieved the highest cosine sim- ilarity (56.22 on the test set), indicating su- perior semantic fidelity to reference captions, while AraViT-GPT showed marginally better n- gram precision and LLM-judge scores.

While pre- vious research has shown the benefits of aug- mentation in text classification, its effective- ness in nuanced domains such as hate and hope speech remains underexplored. Using the anno- tated MAHED dataset, we compare three sce- narios: a baseline without augmentation, global bigram augmentation, and classwise bigram augmentation. The baseline achieved 68.25% accuracy (macro-F1 = 0.6729) on the test set. Global bigram augmentation slightly reduced accuracy to 63.0% (macro-F1 = 0.62), showing no improvement over the baseline. Classwise augmentation achieved 93% accuracy on the validation set but dropped sharply to 59.65% accuracy (macro-F1 = 0.4726) on the test set, indicating severe overfitting. These results sug- gest that bigram-based methods are sensitive to class imbalance and may harm generalisa- tion when applied unevenly across classes. We conclude by highlighting the need for more bal- anced, context-aware augmentation strategies in socially impactful NLP tasks.",

This shared task addresses the paucity of high-quality Arabic medical QA resources by offering two complementary tracks: Men- talQA, focusing on Arabic mental health Q&A (e.g., anxiety, depression, stigma reduction), and MedArabiQ, covering broader medical do- mains such as internal medicine, pediatrics, and clinical decision making. Each track comprises multiple subtasks, evaluation datasets, and stan- dardized metrics, facilitating fair benchmark- ing. The task was structured to promote mod- eling under realistic, multilingual, and cultur- ally nuanced healthcare contexts. We outline the dataset creation, task design and evaluation framework, participation statistics, baseline sys- tems, and summarize the overall outcomes. We conclude with reflections on the performance trends observed and prospects for future itera- tions in Arabic health QA1.",

Auto- matic assessment of Qur\u2019anic recitation at the phoneme level is therefore a critical and chal- lenging task. We present ShallowTransformer, a lightweight and computationally efficient transformer model leveraging Wav2vec2.0 fea- tures and trained with CTC loss for phoneme- level mispronunciation detection. Evaluated on the Iqra\u2019Eval benchmark (QuranMB.v2), our model outperforms published BiLSTM base- lines on QuranMB.v1 while achieving com- petitive performance relative to the official Iqra\u2019Eval challenge baselines, which are not yet fully documented. Such improvements are particularly important in assisted Qur\u2019an learning, as accurate phonetic feedback sup- ports correct recitation and preserves textual integrity. These results highlight the effective- ness of transformer architectures in capturing subtle pronunciation errors while remaining de- ployable for practical applications.",

These methods rely on the principle that combining perspectives enhances problem-solving. In this paper, we propose a collaborative large language models (LLM) framework to solve Islamic inheritance prob- lems, which demand precise mathematical rea- soning and strict adherence to legal rules for fair distribution among heirs. The system im- plements a collaborative voting mechanism involving multiple LLMs, namely ALLaM- 7B-Instruct-preview, Deepseek-reasoner, and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Each independently an- swered multiple-choice inheritance questions. The final answer is determined by majority vote. To improve accuracy and domain grounding, we integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A curated database of solved inheri- tance cases in JSON format is indexed using TF-IDF. For each query, the most similar cases are retrieved and appended as contextual in- formation to the prompt before being submit- ted to the LLMs. Experimental results demon- strate that this collaborative RAG-enhanced framework outperforms individual LLMs. The ensemble achieved 88% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing single models: the fine- tuned ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview (79.50%), Deepeek-reasoner (71.80%), and Gemini-2.5- Flash (83.50%).",

For Subtasks 1\u20132, we sys- tematically compare Arabic-capable LLM fam- ilies (Qwen3, SILMA) under zero-shot and few-shot prompting, few-shot learning with a frozen backbone, parameter-efficient fine- tuning (PEFT), and instruction tuning. To sup- port Subtask 3, we implement a multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that routes queries between curated domain sources and controlled web search; an answer-style controller predicts the required strategy (In- formation, Direct Guidance, Emotional Sup- port) and conditions the generator accord- ingly. Our best LLM configurations reach 0.507/0.404 (weighted-F1/Jaccard) on Subtask 1 with Qwen3+PEFT and 0.750/0.600 on Sub- task 2 with SILMA+PEFT, while a strong fine- tuned MARBERT baseline remains competi- tive at 0.541/0.494 (Subtask 1) and 0.805/0.727 (Subtask 2). For Subtask 3, our multi-agent RAG system with SILMA attains an 0.652 BERTScore F1 and yields a 0.06 hallucination rate under our manual audit.

Our methodology integrates XLM-RoBERTa embeddings with supervised ML and deep learning techniques. After applying Arabic- specific preprocessing, we extract contextual embeddings and mitigate class imbalance using SMOTE . We then train LR and LSTM classi- fiers on the augmented features space, supple- mented by a similarity calculation with Zero- Shot for prediction validation. The system was evaluated in two phases: using the initial val- idation set, and the official updated datasets. Results show competitive performance, partic- ularly in boosting recall for minority classes with a macro score of 0.60.",

        "abstract": "Authorship identification and AI-generated text detection have recently emerged as pivotal ar- eas of research in natural language processing (NLP), with particular urgency for languages such as Arabic that exhibit complex morpho- logical and orthographic structures. Despite growing interest, most prior work has cen- tered on English and other Indo-European lan- guages, leaving a gap in effective approaches tailored to Arabic\u2019s linguistic challenges. This paper presents our participation in two shared tasks: Arabic authorship identification and Ara- bic AI-generated text detection. For Task2, we fine-tuned transformer-based architectures on a corpus of 21 authors, leveraging paral- lelized, semantically segmented book data to better capture stylistic variation. For Task3, we trained models on a balanced dataset of human-written and AI-generated news arti- cles produced by multiple large language mod- els. Our approach achieved competitive results across both tasks, underscoring the potential of domain-adapted transformers for morpholog- ically rich languages. We also highlight key limitations, including domain sensitivity and difficulties in distinguishing closely aligned stylistic features, and propose directions for enhancing cross-domain robustness and gener- alization.",

This uncertainty-aware decoding improves Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) by reducing high-penalty misclassifications to nearer levels. Our approach shows consistent QWK improvements of 1-3 points across dif- ferent base models. In the strict track, our sub- mission achieves QWK scores of 84.9%(test) and 85.7% (blind test) for sentence level, and 73.3% for document level. For Arabic educa- tional assessment, this enables human review- ers to focus on a handful of plausible levels, combining statistical guarantees with practical usability.",

The task addresses the critical gap in multi- modal Arabic NLP by focusing on two com- plementary subtasks: (1) creating the first open-source, manually-captioned Arabic im- age dataset through a collaborative datathon, and (2) developing and evaluating Arabic im- age captioning models. A total of 44 teams registered, of which eight submitted during the test phase, producing 111 valid submis- sions. Evaluation was conducted using au- tomatic metrics, LLM-based judgment, and human assessment. In Subtask 1, the best- performing system achieved a cosine similarity of 65.5, while in Subtask 2, the top score was 60.0. Although these results show encouraging progress, they also confirm that Arabic image captioning remains a challenging task, partic- ularly due to cultural grounding requirements, morphological richness, and dialectal variation. All datasets, baseline models, and evaluation tools are released publicly to support future research in Arabic multimodal NLP.",

However, developing accurate ASR systems for low- resource languages like Arabic remains a signif- icant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable training pipeline that combines weakly super- vised learning with supervised fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the effec- tiveness of weak supervision paired with fine- tuning in overcoming data scarcity and deliver- ing high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect- rich languages.",

We evaluate our ap- proach using Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o on Islamic inheritance MCQ tasks. Results demonstrate significant performance improve- ments when incorporating the thinking step: Claude 3.7 improved from 0.67 to 0.81, and GPT-4o from 0.63 to 0.74. Error analysis re- veals that while models perform well in ba- sic reasoning, they struggle with complex cor- rection procedures (Tasheeh1) in inheritance calculations.

The LLM first proposes candidate la- bels and rationales from a compact taxonomy prompt. A similarity agent then surfaces top- k nearest questions via multilingual sentence- transformer embeddings to induce case-based priors. A verification agent reconciles both signals to produce a final label set with a cal- ibrated confidence, followed by a lightweight post-processor for code parsing and confidence clamping. ERV requires no fine-tuning or exter- nal data and runs efficiently at inference time. In shared-task evaluation, our system achieved 0.61 weighted F1-score for question classifi- cation and 0.73 for answer classification. A hybrid approach combining ERV with MAR- BERT further improves answer classification to 0.80 weighted F1-score.",

We tested the full pipeline on the official ImageEval 2025 benchmarking set, obtaining a cosine similarity of 0.383 and an LLM Judge score of 15.14. The corroborating numerical and qualitative find- ings confirm the viability of a translation-driven methodology for cross-lingual image caption- ing in Arabic, a language often classified as low-resource.

We \ufb01ne-tuned an LLM for detecting Quran and Ha- dith text spans, utilizing synthetic augmenta- tion, diacritic variation, and morphological nor- malization to improve detection robustness (F1 = 87.10%) and used another reasoning model with tools (F1 = 90.06%). For validation, the accuracy is 88.60%, and for correction the ac- curacy is 66.56% where we employed a lay- ered hierarchical index and search algorithm combining exact, normalized, fuzzy, and se- mantic matching with prompt-driven repair\u2014to ensure canonical alignment and diacritic \ufb01- delity. For the correction stage, we also uti- lized a reasoning model with access to tools with an accuracy of 61.04%. Regarding the ranked answer-bearing text retrieval task, we implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Genera- tion (RAG) system restricted to the corpora pro- vided by the shared task, with structured out- put, vector-store grounding, and prompts tuned for \u201canswer-enclosing\u201d citations that achieve MAP@10 of 0.6199 on the development set and 0.2807 on the test set. The results highlight the value of normalization, corpus-restricted search, and reasoning models with tools in mit- igating hallucinations and improving retrieval precision in low-resource religious settings and that much smaller \ufb01ne-tuned models can com- pete with frontier models (e.g. GPT-5 high)",

This paper presents our sys- tems for the MAHED 2025 shared task on Multimodal Detection of Hope and Hate Emo- tions in Arabic Content, addressing the two text-based subtasks. Our approach centers on a systematic, empirical comparison of Arabic- native versus large-scale multilingual Trans- former encoders to determine the optimal pre- training strategy for this nuanced domain. Com- prehensive evaluations demonstrate the clear superiority of Arabic-native models, with our ARBERTv2-based system achieving the high- est performance. We secured 11th place in Sub- task 1 with a macro F1-score of 0.682 and 5th place in Subtask 2 with a macro F1-score of 0.514. Error analysis reveals persistent chal- lenges in interpreting implicit language and overcoming severe class imbalance, particu- larly in distinguishing targeted hate from gen- eral offensiveness. This work contributes a ro- bust benchmark for this comparison and un- derscores the importance of language-specific pre-training for nuanced affective computing in Arabic.",

Working under data constraints by using only the provided shared task resources for dialect adaptation, we explore effective model adaptation strate- gies for dialectal Arabic speech. For ADI, we fine-tune w2v-BERT 2.0 and employ voice con- version as data augmentation, improving accu- racy from 68.71% to 76.40% on a blind cross- domain test set. For ASR, we develop two complementary approaches: (1) a CTC-based model pre-trained on public Arabic speech data, and (2) Whisper-based models using two- stage fine-tuning. Our experiments show that while dialect-centric CTC models exhibit bet- ter zero-shot dialectal performance (58.89 vs 93.90 WER), Whisper achieves better perfor- mance after dialect-specific adaptation, which reduces WER from 93.89 to 39.78 WER. We also demonstrate that using character error rate (CER) as a validation criterion provides prac- tical benefits with minimal performance trade- offs. Despite using no external resources for dialect adaptation beyond the shared task data, our systems ranked second in ADI and third in ASR, demonstrating that careful adaptation strategies can overcome data constraints in di- alectal speech processing.",

Building upon prior work that fine-tuned pre-trained transformer models (Elmadani et al., 2025b), this work explores the impact of incorporating a rich set of handcrafted features on readability pre- diction performance. A total of 51 features were extracted from the BAREC corpus (El- madani et al., 2025b), including morpholog- ical, lexical, and syntactic indicators, lever- aging established computational linguistics tools. These features were integrated into a hybrid architecture that combines transformer- based contextual embeddings with dense lay- ers for feature processing. To optimize perfor- mance, experiments included freezing strate- gies and gradual unfreezing, alongside architec- tural variations with additional classification layers. Among the tested models, the best performance was achieved with MARBERT, reaching a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 80.95% on the test set, and 83.1% on the blind test set.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs), AI-generated content has in- creased, presenting new opportunities and sig- nificant risks. Detecting such content is cru- cial, yet while research in high-resource lan- guages like English has advanced, work in low- resource languages, such as Arabic, remains limited. To help fill this gap, the AraGenEval 2025 workshop organized a shared task on AI- generated Text Detection in Arabic. We partic- ipated in Task 3, where we evaluated several transformer-based models, including AraBERT, RoBERTa, AraRoBERTa, mBERT, and mar- BERT, both with and without chunking of input sequences during training. The experimental re- sults show that applying chunking prior to train- ing improves the performance of transformers. Among the evaluated models by the system testset, AraBERT with chunking achieved the highest F1 score (0.67), outperforming the oth- ers. Based on these results, our team ranked 12th in Shared Task 3.",

We addressed two subtasks. For the text-based subtask (Task 2), we experimented with multiple models, including Support Vector Machines with TF- IDF and AraBERT embeddings, XGBoost with fused AraBERT and XLM-RoBERTa embed- dings optimized via Optuna, and a fine-tuned AraBERT model and GPT-5 (gpt-oss-20b). The fine-tuned AraBERT achieved the best perfor- mance with an F1 score of 0.68. For the mul- timodal subtask (Task 3), we proposed an ar- chitecture combining DistilBERT for text rep- resentation with a lightweight ELU-Net en- hanced by a cross-attention mechanism, reach- ing 75% accuracy. Major challenges included dataset imbalance and noisy text, which we mit- igated through preprocessing, class-weighted optimization, and feature fusion. Our results demonstrate the benefits of combining mul- tiple embedding layers for text classification and leveraging lightweight multimodal archi- tectures for robust hate speech detection in Ara- bic.",

This emo- tional transmission can amplify positive senti- ments that foster community resilience or prop- agate harmful content that divides societies. While hate speech detection in Arabic has been extensively studied, hope speech detection has received comparatively limited attention, cre- ating an imbalance in the understanding of emotional influence online. To address this gap, MAHED 2025 sub-task 1 introduced the task of detecting both hope and hate speech using a substantial dataset designed for devel- oping robust classification models. This pa- per presents an ensemble approach combining three Transformer-based encoder models with soft voting and weighted loss functions to ad- dress class imbalance issues. Those models, ArabicDeBERTa-DA, BERT-DA, and MAR- BERTV2, have been continually pre-trained on different domains of Arabic, showing the ben- efits of continual pre-training both on down- stream performance and computational effi- ciency. The proposed ensemble model achieved the highest performance in the competition with an F1 macro score of 72.3% using an en- semble voting of the best-performing variants.",

TAQEEM 2025 includes two subtasks: Task A on holis- tic scoring and Task B on trait-specific scor- ing. It introduces a new (and first of its kind) dataset of 1,265 Arabic essays, annotated with holistic and trait-specific scores, including rel- evance, organization, vocabulary, style, devel- opment, mechanics, and grammar. The main goal of TAQEEM is to address the scarcity of standardized benchmarks and high-quality resources in Arabic AES. TAQEEM 2025 at- tracted 11 registered teams for Task A and 10 for Task B, with a total of 5 teams, across both tasks, submitting system runs for evalu- ation.

Our systems achieved 4th/15 (0.895)inSubtask1and3rd/10(0.9259)inSub- task 2, demonstrating the e\ufb00ectiveness of tar- geted retrieval in open-web contexts and struc- tured prompting in closed-domain Arabic QA.",

However, working with divine sources such as the Holy Quran and Hadith presents unique challenges. These Classical Arabic texts have, for centuries, been metic- ulously preserved and recited word-for-word, allowing no tolerance for errors \u2014 even a sin- gle incorrect diacritic can entirely alter the meaning. Such sensitivity demands excep- tional precision, as hallucinations or inaccura- cies from LLMs could lead to significant misin- terpretations among general users. To address this challenge, we present an Arabic-focused, LLM-powered framework designed to identify and verify the integrity of religious text gen- erated by widely used LLMs. Evaluation on benchmark subtasks demonstrates strong per- formance, achieving a Macro-Avg F1 score of 86.11% on Subtask 1A and an Accuracy of 89.82% on Subtask 1B.",

Our approach employed data augmentation to address class imbalance, as certain categories in the dataset were signifi- cantly underrepresented. Since our method re- lied on prompting models to classify questions and answers as well as to generate answers for the QA system, we utilized Gradient-free Edit- Based Instruction Search (GrIPS) to optimize prompt selection. Our system achieved strong results across all three subtasks, ranking 1st in answer classification and 3rd in both question classification and QA system answer genera- tion.",

Rec- ognizing its importance, we addressed this chal- lenge using the AraGenEval 2025shared task dataset, which contains works by writers from diverse backgrounds and time periods. We con- ducted extensive experiments with multiple ar- chitectures and proposed an ensemble model that combines the strengths of four fine-tuned transformer-based models. We applied data augmentation to enrich the dataset and class weighting to handle class imbalance during training. Our system achieved a Macro-F1 score of 90%, representing a 15% improve- ment over our baseline, and ranked 1st in the competition.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demon- strated impressive multilingual capabilities; however, their reasoning often reflects English- centric perspectives, which can limit accuracy in culture-specific contexts. Arabic, with its diverse dialects, rich historical heritage, and complex socio-cultural norms, presents a par- ticularly challenging setting for such evalua- tion. To address this gap, we participated in the PalmX 2025 shared task, which bench- marks cultural reasoning in Arabic through multiple-choice questions covering traditions, social norms, history, geography, arts, and di- alectal expressions. By applying parameter- efficient adaptation and culturally informed prompt formatting, we aligned model outputs with both linguistic correctness and cultural rel- evance. Our approach achieved an accuracy of 71.65%, securing second placeoverall and closely matching the top system. These results demonstrate that targeted adaptation can sig- nificantly enhance cultural reasoning in LLMs, paving the way for more culturally aware Arti- ficial Intelligence.",

The dataset used is PalmX, which is an MCQ benchmark dataset. In this work, traditional and AI gen- eration data augmentations are used. For the cultural domain, we applied data augmenta- tion techniques, including paraphrasing using Fanar-1-9B-Instruct model and answer shuf- fling. For the Islamic domain, we used the original dataset without augmentation to main- tain content integrity. We then fine-tuned the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model on both datasets and evaluate its performance, achieving 65.90% accuracy on the cultural set and 70.83% on the Islamic set. Experiment and evaluation are dis- cussed and the best accuracy achieved in this work is explained in both domains.",

We developed a hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines sparse and dense re- trieval methods with cross-encoder reranking to improve large language model (LLM) per- formance. Our three-stage pipeline incorpo- rates BM25 for initial retrieval, a dense em- bedding retrieval model for semantic matching, and cross-encoder reranking for precise content retrieval. We evaluate our approach on both subtasks using two LLMs, Fanar and Mistral, demonstrating that the proposed RAG pipeline enhances performance across both, with accu- racy improvements up to 25%, depending on the task and model configuration. Our best configuration is achieved with Fanar, yielding accuracy scores of 45% in Subtask 1 and 80% in Subtask 2.",

A total of 44 teams registered, and during the testing phase, 100 valid submissions were received from eight unique teams. The distribution was as follows: 34 submissions for Subtask 1 \u201cfive teams\u201d, 47 submissions for Subtask 2 \u201csix teams\u201d, and 19 submissions for Subtask 3 \u201ctwo teams\u201d. The best-performing systems achieved 79.8% accuracy on Subtask 1, 35.68/12.20 WER/CER (overall average) on Subtask 2, and 55/13 WER/CER on Subtask 3. These results highlight the ongoing challenges of Arabic di- alect speech processing, particularly in dialect identification, recognition, and diacritic restora- tion. We also summarize the methods adopted by participating teams and briefly outline direc- tions for future editions of NADI.1",

        "abstract": "The rise of social media and online communi- cation platforms has led to the spread of Ara- bic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression. While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also increasingly being used to spread offensive lan- guage and hate speech. Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in Arabic text and meme. This paper explores the potential of large language models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, of- fensive language, and emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the perfor- mance of base LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models . The evaluation is conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results under- score the capacity of LLMs such as GPT-4o- mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash 2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for task 1, 2, and 3, respec- tively and secure first place overall in the chal- lenge1 (Zaghouani et al., 2025). The proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes for accurate and effi- cient Arabic content moderation systems.",

Rather than relying solely on end-to- end captioning, VLCAP grounds generation in interpretable Arabic visual concepts extracted with three multilingual encoders, mCLIP, Ara- CLIP, and Jina V4, each evaluated separately for label retrieval. A hybrid vocabulary is built from training captions and enriched with about 21K general domain labels translated from the Visual Genome dataset, covering ob- jects, attributes, and scenes. The top- k re- trieved labels are transformed into fluent Ara- bic prompts and passed along with the origi- nal image to vision\u2013language models. In the second stage, we tested Qwen-VL and Gem- ini Pro Vision for caption generation, resulting in six encoder\u2013decoder configurations. The results show that mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vi- sion achieved the best BLEU-1 (5.34%) and cosine similarity (60.01%), while AraCLIP + Qwen-VL obtained the highest LLM-judge score (36.33%).

This task is crucial for building safer online communi- ties and has applications in content modera- tion, social media analysis, and digital well- being initiatives. We systematically evalu- ate six transformer-based encoders, comparing Arabic-specific models (MARBERT, AraBERT, ALCALM) against multilingual alternatives (XLM-RoBERTa, LaBSE, BGE). Our approach demonstrates that specialized Arabic models specially encoders trained on more than one dialect like marber significantly outperform their multilingual counterparts, with MAR- BERT achieving the best overall performance.

The system ranks answer options ac- cording to semantic relevance, and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reason- ing. We evaluate Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context- dependent. Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a com- pelling case for efficiency, on-device deploya- bility, and privacy. While this is lower than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the practical advantages of smaller, specialized sys- tems in high-stakes domains.",

In this study, we present an ef- fective approach for detecting hateful content in Arabic memes using theQCRI Prop2Hate- Memedataset, which contains image\u2013text pairs labeled for hatefulness. We experimented with several multimodal configurations, and the best performance was achieved using a combina- tion of InceptionNet for visual features and multilingual BERT for text. These represen- tations were fused after applying normaliza- tion and augmentation to enhance robustness. OurInceptionNetwithmBERTconfiguration achieved a macro F1-score of 63 percent and secured the sixth position on the official Cod- aBench leaderboard. These findings highlight the strength of our multimodal model and sup- port its potential for detecting harmful Arabic content in low-resource settings.",

Our approach uses multimodal fu- sion combining a visual encoder and an Ara- bic text encoder. We explored four fusion strategies\u2014transformer fusion, early fusion, cross-attention, and bilinear fusion\u2014and found transformer fusion offered the best single- model trade-off, while an ensemble of all four achieved the highest score. To address the severe class imbalance (90.05% not-hate vs. 9.95% hate), we applied class-weighted loss, focal loss, strong regularization, and light aug- mentation. Our best submission reached a macro-F1 score of 0.75 on the gold test set.",

We implemented a pipeline involving translation of Arabic captions to English, followed by back-translation to generate fluent Arabic out- puts. We evaluated several vision-language models, including Qwen2.5 VL (7B), Llama 3.2 (11B), and Pixtral (12B). The Qwen2.5 VL (7B) model achieved a BLEU-1 score of 22.6, a Cosine Similarity of 57.48, and an LLM Judge Score of 31.43, securing third place in the com- petition.

The task re- quires a robust understanding of both visual and textual information and their interplay. We developed and compared three distinct multi- modal fusion architectures: a Cross-Attention model, a progressive CNN-based fusion model, and a two-stage model using custom-trained embeddings with a gated fusion classifier. All models leverage pre-trained CLIP and MAR- BERT encoders for image and text represen- tation, respectively. We detail our approach to handling the significant class imbalance in the dataset through data re-splitting and the application of a weighted Focal Loss. Our post- competition analysis, training on all available data, shows that the CNN-based fusion model achieved the highest macro F1-score of 0.779, demonstrating the effectiveness of its hierarchi- cal feature extraction for this task.",

We focus on the QIAS 2025 shared task, which evaluates LLMs on two subtasks: Islamic inheritance reasoning and general Is- lamic knowledge assessment. Prior works in Arabic NLP and religious QA largely empha- size retrieval and classification, but they do not evaluate multi-step procedural reasoning. To fill this gap, we propose a hybrid multi-agent framework, termed Retrieval-Augmented Rea- soning (RAR). For inheritance problems, our Virtual Inheritance Expert parses natural lan- guage cases into structured JSON, retrieves rel- evant fatwas, and applies rule-based synthesis. For general knowledge, our Proponent\u2013Critic Debate simulates dialectical reasoning, with a head scholar model providing final judgment. Using an ensemble of Gemini, Fanar, and Mis- tral, our system achieved 2nd place in Subtask 1 and 1st place in Subtask 2. These results demonstrate that decomposing complex reason- ing into specialized pipelines supports robust- ness and accuracy in high-stakes domains.",

Our system models each document as a sentence-level graph, where nodes rep- resent sentences and lemmas, and edges cap- ture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class membership. Sen- tence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as well as contextual em- beddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph neural network (GNN) and trans- former sentence encoder are trained as two independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level out- puts are aggregated using max pooling to re- flect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results show that this hybrid method outper- forms standalone GNN or transformer branches across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only ap- proach remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.",

        "abstract": "Cultural understanding is essential for large language models (LLMs), particularly in the Arabic context where many models struggle to capture nuanced cultural elements. To ad- dress this gap, we propose a novel approach for Arabic cultural multiple-choice question answering that integrates retrieval-based train- ing data augmentation with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our system employs Gemini 1 to retrieve contextual evidence for each question, selects candidate pairs, and adapts NileChat- 3B by fine-tuning only three projection layers, reducing trainable parameters by 68.2% while preserving general language proficiency. On the PalmX 2025 Subtask 1 benchmark 2, our system attains 67.60% accuracy on the blind test set, ranking 6th overall and outperforming the NileChat-3B baseline by 3% on the devel- opment set. The model weights are publicly available at MohamedGomaa30/Ibn-Al-Nafs.",
